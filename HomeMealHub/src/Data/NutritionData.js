For portion-controlled healthy fats, a quarter cup of mixed nuts provides satiety. Plain Greek yogurt with cinnamon is another excellent high-protein choice. Air-popped popcorn (about 3 cups for 100 calories) gives volume for few calories, while cottage cheese with pineapple offers calcium and protein. Other good options include tuna on whole grain crackers, roasted chickpeas for crunch, or a simple protein smoothie made with powder, water and ice.",
